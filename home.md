## Welcome. I am Aditi Bhatia.

User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) designer with peculiar insight into conceptual, behavioral and usability elements of interaction design. In addition, I am an amateur digital media theorist with analytical vision on societal effects of digital and social media.

Delve into my portfolio to get a gist of the mediums I have explored.
