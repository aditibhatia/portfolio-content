## Hello. I am Aditi Bhatia.

A user experience design and research enthusiast with a focus on theories revolving around its conceptual, behavioral and usability elements. I have a passion for comprehending digital culture, analysing the ways devices, digital and social media interactions, consciously or subconsciously, impacts the ways one perceives the world, and using this understanding to enhance design thinking. All my designs and strategies integrate this analytical approach through visualizing the perspective of a recipient.

Delve into my portfolio to get a gist of the mediums I have explored.
