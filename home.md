## Welcome. I am Aditi Bhatia.

A digital media and communications technology enthusiast with a focus on theories revolving around its conceptual, behavioral and usability elements. I have a passion for comprehending digital culture, analysing the ways affordances of digital devices, consciously or subconsciously, affect the way one evolves or devolves certain elements of cognition and perceive their world. As a result, I try to leverage a user centric approach to all my communication strategies and designs. 


Key Interests: Digital Strategy| Communications | User Experience | Social Media | Experience Design | Digital Marketing


Delve into my portfolio to get a gist of the mediums I have explored.
