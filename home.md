## Welcome. I am Aditi Bhatia.

A digital technology communications and interaction design enthusiast with a focus on theories revolving around its conceptual, behavioral and usability elements. I have a passion for comprehending digital culture, analysing the ways devices, digital and social media interactions, consciously or subconsciously, impacts the ways one perceives the world. All my communications strategies and designs integrate this analytical approach by visualizing the perspective of a recipient.

Delve into my portfolio to get a gist of the mediums I have explored.
