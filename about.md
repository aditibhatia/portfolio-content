## About Me

Currently based in Toronto, Canada I am an interaction designer with an in-depth acumen of the digital media landscape along with expertise in digital media theory and praxis.

Being born in Toronto, raised in New Delhi, India and schooled in Silicon Valley, California, provides me with a broad and diverse worldview. I am a Masters in Digital Media (2015) candidate at Ryerson University, Digital Media Zone, Canada's largest business incubator and the fifth in the world.

Successful completion of the first term of Masters in Digital Media program provides me with an extensive knowledge in digital media foundations, entrepreneurship, interaction design, environments and intrapersonal communication. At Ryerson, Interaction Design coursework within Digital Media informs me about user engagement, cognition, perception, interactive storytelling and usage of interactive mockup design tools. The Digital Media Environments coursework familiarizes me with regulations and standards of the digital world landscape, production skills, and an exploration of the project development cycle. The entrepreneurship course enhances my understanding of business models, basic competitive strategies and procedures to launch an entrepreneurial start-up company in the digital media sector.

The foundations of digital media coursework at Ryerson introduces me to technological, social, legal and ethical issues of the field. I had an opportunity to historically and critically explore and analyze the economics, technical innovations, social demands and ethical constraints that define the digital media landscape. Furthermore, Interpersonal Communication course facilitates clear and persuasive communication within effective interdisciplinary team environments targeting onto  improvisation, effective listening, diverse audiences engagement, and conflicts resolution.

I gained Bachelors of Art Honours from University of Toronto (2014) majoring in New Media Studies, while minoring in Media Studies and Studio Art. The combination of these interrelated genres provided an artistic approach to my theory and praxis knowledge-base of digital media landscape. Overall, my education at University of Toronto burgeons my appeal to digital humanities through analytical and critical insight into contemporary digital-social media environment. During my undergrad at University of Toronto, I have had extensive leadership experience, which strengthens my time-management skills, while making me adaptable and consistent.

Moreover, I have attained Ontario College Certification in New Media Design with honours from Centennial College (2013), which lays my preliminary foundation in UX/UI Design. Additionally, I learnt content production for web through practical work-experience with the real world clients for web design and development. The practical training at Centennial makes me adroit at Adobe Creative Suite: Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, Audition, and video editing with Final Cut Pro. Moreover, builds my fluency with basic programming languages as HTML5 and CSS. Through project development coursework, I acquired comprehensive skill set of establishing a project from concept to delivery within the realm of digital media.

I look forward to the chance to cross disciplines and seek novel ventures.
