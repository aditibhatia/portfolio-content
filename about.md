## About Me

Education in digital media, user experience and interaction design prepares me well for an intensive user experience role.

### Graduate degree, Master of Digital Media 
#### Yeates School of Graduate Studies, Ryerson University, Toronto (2015)
The Master of Digital program intersects three key areas of digital media: art & design, technology, and business & entrepreneurship. I have gained knowledge pertinent to digital landscape in each of these areas that helps strategize solutions from innovative angles.

### Bachelors of Arts Honours, New Media Studies 
#### University of Toronto (2014)
Majoring in New Media Studies has prepared me for careers in Web communication and new media industries. Along with an overview of theoretical and critical understandings of media: political, economic, social and cultural contexts in which mediated images and texts are produced, distributed, and consumed.

### Certificate, Digital Strategy & Communications Management 
#### University of Toronto – School of Continuing Education (Present)
Focus on developing strategies and initiatives that resonate with the audience and build engagement and community. Learning to integrate strategic approach with hands-on experience using platforms and tools within the rapidly changing digital and social media landscape.

### Ontario College Certification, New Media Design with Honours 
#### Centennial College, Toronto (2013)
Technical education through practice-based courses on multimedia design for Web and mobile application: Adobe Creative Suite, video production and front-end programming. These skills enhanced through professional practice course and industry experience with a Digital Media and Design internship at Toronto District School Board. 

I look forward to the chance to cross disciplines and seek novel ventures.
