## About Me

A New Media enthusiast with expertise in consumer culture and advertising theories gained through coursework as an undergraduate at University of Toronto majoring in New Media Studies and minoring in Media Studies and Studio Art.

Gained practical experience in graphic design, web design and development from concept to delivery, basic animation, video-graphing, and video editing through coursework in New Media Design Certification from Centennial College and industry work experience.

I look forward to the chance to cross disciplines with innovative ideas and rationale. Delve into my portfolio website to get a gist of the mediums I have explored.
